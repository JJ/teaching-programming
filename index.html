	  <h1>We've all learned to program</h1>
	  <h2 class='fragment'>... the hard way</h2>
	  <aside class='notes'>When I turned 50, I looked at my options. A convertible was off the table, and I felt old for a new mistress. So I said, yes, I know, I'll learn a new programming language, and I started with Scala. It took three different books and lots of visits to StackOverflow to finally find my way to create a small 20 lines program</aside>

	  <pre><code>10 PRINT "Hello world!"</code></pre>

	int main(){
	printf("Hello World!");

<section data-background='img/duck-typing.png' alt='duck typing'>
  <aside class='notes'>There are weirder things than consoles. We have duck typing, for instance, a concept that looks obvious for those who use it, but it is not. Lots of different concepts that are behind a language, and that go beyond the syntax</aside>
</section>

<section data-background='img/monads.png' alt='Monads: monkey activities in a disco'>
  <aside class='notes'>And then if you try to learn Haskell, Scala or Clojure, we have monads. Monkey activities in a disco. Voilà </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <section><h1>Programs are made for running</h1></section>
  <section data-background='https://farm1.staticflickr.com/152/425567315_06b54ba6d5_b_d.jpg' alt='tools'>
    <aside class='notes'>And you need to know the build tools in order to do that</aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <img src='img/commandline.png'>
    <aside class='notes'>And then you have to run it. Command line, deploy it somewhere, set up environment, lots of different things. Although in the beginning was the command line</aside>
  </section>
</section>

<section>
  <section><h1>People don't <em>really</em> want to program</h1></section>
  <section><h1>They want to <em>create</em> stuff</h1></section>
  <section data-background='img/dots.jpg'>
    <aside class='notes'>It's as if you are teaching people how to draw dots, or, as it were, to glue confetti to a canvas</aside>
  </section>
  <section data-background='img/painting.jpg'>
    <aside class='notes'>But what they want is to learn to paint something like this</aside>
  </section>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>1. The toolchain is the new programming language</h1>
  <aside class='notes'>You need to know lots of things, some of them written in other languages, some in DSLs, but that's stuff you need to do. If you just learn a couple of boilerplate expressions, you'll fall into cargo cult programming</aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>2. The full stack is the new architecture.</h1>

  <aside class='notes'>And there's even more complicated stuff, the Lambda and Kappa architecture, microservices and lots of things that do not fit in a single language.</aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>3. Deployment is the new running a command.</h1>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>4. Team programming is tne new solo programming.</h1>
  <h2 class='fragment'>And Slack is the new mailman</h2>

  <aside class='notes'>You always work in a team, and even if you don't, you depend on tools that are free software and that reside in GitHub, where you can create issues, do pull requests... </aside>

</section>

<section>
  <section>
    <h1>5. Best practices are the new <em>This can be done, but shouldn't</em></h1>
    <aside class='notes'>For instante, comments. In the book I am writing on Perl, the first program does not do anything, and has a comment that says exactly that.</aside>
  </section>
  <section>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env perl

# This program does zilch</code></pre>
  </section>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>6. StackOverflow is the new RTFM</h1>
  <aside class='notes'>But using it is not trivial, proper protocol is needed. And it is not a read-only resource. You've got to be there to help others too.</aside>

</section>

<section>
  <h1>7. Testing is the new debugging</h1>
  <h2 class='fragment'>But the old debugging is the new debugging too</h2>

  <aside class='notes'>Things need not go wrong if testing is done carefully. Also code revision, code proofs in functional languages, and so on. But they can, and do so in production. You have to learn when to debug. </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>8. The browser is the new operating system</h1>
  <h2 class='fragment'>And JavaScript the new <code>bash</code></h2>
  <h3 class='fragment'>Fortunately, JS <em>is</em> a language</h3>
  <h3 class='fragment'>... almost</h3>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>9. Loving the error messages is the new hating the error messages</h1>

  <aside class='notes'>Error messages are informative, stateful, typed, and all kind of things. They don't dump the memory in a file with a stack to dig into and find where your pointer went off base. They are actionable, and tell you what you can do about them. Teaching how to interpret and what to do about errors will save them trips to StackOverflow and the bashing that often goes with the first experiences.</aside>

</section>

<section>
  <h1>10. Unicode is the new ASCII,</h1>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>immutable data structures are the new constants</h1>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>and multi-paradigm programming is the new procedural programming</h1>
  <aside class='notes'>Modern programming includes a lot of semi-low-level concepts that need to be understood. Even object and classes are something that is very basic; monads and lambda calculus too, and even category theory is needed to understand type systems. And this has to be taught <em>along</em> with the new languages, as natural concepts, not before because it would be boring or after because it will not be really understood. Batteries must be included, which means that you have to load the programming language with the concepts needed to understand it, and do it from the get go. If it is a multiparadigm, devote a few of asides to explain the paradigms and when to use them.</aside>
